# TCSS-462-Python-vs-Java

In this project, we focus on the comparison of Java and Python 
- within the frameworks of ARM and x86 architectures.
With the goal of comparing the two languages with the different
architectures, we plan to find the differences of different
runtimes, how much each cost, the performance, and so on.
